      <h2 class="h2-bold">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
      current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
      got every penny's worth.

      <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
          who head an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
          course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
          Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
          working as a Software Engineer at a VR Startup.""

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
        Getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was easy.

        "The staff seem genuinely about my progress which I find really refreshing.
        The program gave me the confidance necessary to be able to go out in the
        world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above
        the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
        incredible community of smart and amazing people."

      <h2 class="h2-bold-dark">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
          and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
          long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
          have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
          development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
